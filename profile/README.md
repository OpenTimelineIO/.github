The OpenTimelineIO github organization is a federation of repos relating to the 
[OpenTimelineIO core](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO)
project.

Repositories stored in this organization include adapters, language bindings
(except python, which is [part of the core](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO/tree/main/src/py-opentimelineio)),
examples, and more.

## Support

These subprojects are part of the OpenTimelineIO project but may be supported
differently than the OpenTimelineIO core.

This may include:

- Repos primarily maintained by community members with OpenTimelineIO core team members only providing guidance
- Repos provided for informational or archival purposes that aren't actively maintained

Please consult READMEs in individual subproject repos to learn more about their
maintainance and support.

## ADAPTER REPO NOTICE

The OpenTimelineIO community is currently working through a
[reorganization of the adapters](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO/issues/1386)
and is working through breaking them out. For the moment, users should continue
to use adapters that come with the
[PyPI opentimelineio package](https://pypi.org/project/OpenTimelineIO/).
